## About Olist's <a name="business_understanding"></a>
Olist is for everyone "who wants to sell more and better" and "who wants to attract new customers". As a business in the e-commerce sector, Olist is an online selling platform for small businesses. On Olist's sign-up page a range of shopkeeper profiles is listed which fits the business model. A strong focus is on attracting more customers through a larger market presence. A user satisfaction report helps to address areas of attention. Olist therefore acts as a service provider which is managing the sales process for the shopkeepers. Olist doen't own any of the offered products and is also not managing shipping or inventory.

## Business objectives <a name="objectives"></a>
The goal of the analysis is to extract information that supports Olist's business objectives. These objectives are: Attracting more shopkeepers by enhancing the service and attracting more end-customers through a broader product spectrum and higher satisfaction. The analysis is part of a business case that is looking into expanding Olist's service to also include logistics and warehousing, something Olist is not offering at the moment.
In detail, the analysis is firstly investigating correlations in the order data with the goal to find potentially important insights that can be integrated into the enhanced service. Secondly, the analysis investigates how the business is developing and how dynamic it changes from day to day. This includes also to find extreme events. Thirdly, a prediction about the size of the business for a future scenario needs to be modelled. This all is base of a selection- and definition process for the potential logistic concept, and eventually a business case. Questions that will be answered in this analysis are in detail:
- Are there correlations and patterns in the data which are important for the concept?
- What is the general business trend?
- How dynamic is the operation and are there extreme events which impact logistic process?
- What does the prediction say about the business in two years?
