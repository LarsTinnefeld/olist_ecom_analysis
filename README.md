## About Olist's <a name="business_understanding"></a>
Olist is for everyone "who wants to sell more and better" and "who wants to attract new customers". As a business in the e-commerce sector, Olist is an online selling platform for small businesses. On Olist's sign-up page a range of shopkeeper profiles is listed which fits the business model. A strong focus is on attracting more customers through a larger market presence. A user satisfaction report helps to address areas of attention. Olist therefore acts as a service provider which is managing the sales process for the shopkeepers. Olist doen't own any of the offered products and is also not managing shipping or inventory.

## Business objectives <a name="objectives"></a>
The goal of the analysis is to extract information that supports Olist's business objectives. These objectives are: Attracting more shopkeepers by enhancing the service and attracting more end-customers through a broader product spectrum and higher satisfaction. The analysis is part of a business case that is looking into expanding Olist's service to also include logistics and warehousing, something Olist is not offering at the moment.
