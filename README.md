## Objectives
The ultimate goal of the work in this notebook is to extract meaningful information from a set of data- and lookup tables from OLIST, a Brazilian e-commerce department store (SaaS). *Meaningful* in this context means adequate to serve as a base for beneficial data driven decision making. The analysis will be focussed on three points of attention:
- Trends in the business development and a prognosis where the business is headed
- Main contributors to user satisfaction and a model with allows to predict the impact of changes
- Analysis of the physical product characteristics and SKU profile to identify qualification for potential logistic process automation

* About Olist (Business understanding)
* The data (files, content, relations...)
